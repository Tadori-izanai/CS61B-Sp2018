/** A rather contrived exercise to test your understanding of when
    nested classes may be made static. This is NOT an example of good
    class design, even after you fix the bug.

    The challenge with this file is to delete the keyword static the
    minimum number of times so that the code compiles.

    Guess before TRYING to compile, otherwise the compiler will spoil
    the problem.*/
